# SpeedDial-FVD-Cleansed
This is a "forked" version of the [Speed Dial [FVD] - New Tab Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speed-dial-fvd-new-tab-pa/llaficoajjainaijghjlofdfmbjpebpa?hl=en). Since the developer, nimbus had decided to start doing ad redirects I've decided to remove them. If they get their act together or Google removes/forces them to stop then I'll remove this.

Current Modifications:
* Removed Ad redirects
* Changed default search to Google

In-progress
* Started on adding on-dial search for more sites.
  * need to figure out how it's parsing the data it's collecting to send it to search. seems to be site specific.

To-do:
* Remove data collection
* Remove or disable Everysync or figure out ways to make it more optional.
* Improve general transparency of the extension - lots of suspect code
* Remove Russian connections - Yandex, several Russian sites
  *  where it feels neccessary
* Add new search providers : DuckDuckGo, Youtube, Reddit, etc.
* Add ability to export settings to file and re-import from file instead of text string - maybe
