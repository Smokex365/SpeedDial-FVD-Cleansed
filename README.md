# SpeedDial-FVD-Cleansed
Since the developer, nimbus had decided to start doing ad redirects I've decided to remove them. If they get their act together or Google removes/forces them to stop then I'll remove this.

Current Modifications:
* Removed Ad redirects
* Changed default search to Google
* Started on adding on-dial search for more sites
